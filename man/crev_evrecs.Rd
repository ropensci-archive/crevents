\description{
Parse Crossref Events evidence records
}
\details{
this function doesn't parse results other than converting
JSON to an R list, because the data is deeply nested, so coercing
to data.frame's is an exercise left to the user

From \code{\link[=crev_query]{crev_query()}} you will get  urls like
"https://evidence.eventdata.crossref.org/evidence" in the
\verb{$message$events$evidence_record} slot of results. These links
hold JSOn data with the evidence record details for the record. This
function simply retrieves that JSON and parses to a list
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
res <- crev_query(rows = 4)
recs <- res$message$events$evidence_record
crev_evrecs(recs[1])
crev_evrecs(recs)
}
}
